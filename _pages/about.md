I'm a second year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University with a dream of combining theoretical semantics with computational linguistics. If we can marry the formal rigor of semantics with machine learning, we can create a hybrid system which handles a wider range of less-common cases than the ultimately frequency-powered machine learning systems currently available. Moreover, a hybrid system need not rely on massive piles of data to even get started. I also want to get involved in the flip side of this, which is to use computation to further advances in linguistics &ndash; discourse modelling, psycholinguistics and language acquisition all benefit from computational models.

I have a deep love for theory and formalisms, with a soft spot for lambda calculus, fancy operators and continuation semantics. I'm currently pursuing projects in theoretical and experimental semantics on anaphora and indefinites, including work on crossover and the handling of indefinites and discourse referents. I'm also thinking about how to marry modality and genericity with event semantics. 
While theory is what brings me the most joy, I'm also quite comfortable running experiments and writing code from data analysis scripts to machine learning to web apps. (In a former life, I spent three years as a software developer.)

I'm always interested in the debate of whether we need linguistics for NLP. I'm also very interested in the question of whether NLP and language acquisition are converging &ndash; whether the trending "more data and bigger models" approach to NLP will end up converging on a structure remarkably similar to how humans learn and encode language. 

When I'm not doing research, you can find me reading, hiking (ideally in the Swiss Alps!) and spoiling my fluffy black cat, Aurora. If you ever need a native Swiss German (or British English) speaker for your research, let me know.
