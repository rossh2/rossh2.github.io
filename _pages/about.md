I'm a second year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University. Before becoming a linguist, I studied mathematics at Oxford University and computational linguistics at Brandeis University. I also spent a couple of years in industry as a software developer. 
This leaves me with a wider range of interests than is necessarily practical, but right now I'm focusing on formal semantics and computational linguistics. You can usually find me in the mathematical end of semantics working on modality, anaphora, implicatures or anything else with a lot of operators and lambda calculus. 

I have a particular love for theory and formalisms, but I'm also happy running experiments and writing code from data analysis scripts to machine learning to (in theory) web apps. 
I'm currently both pursuing semantics on its own and also trying to marry the formal rigor of semantics with machine learning, which the goal of creating a hybrid system which can handle a wider range of less-common cases than the ultimately frequency-powered machine learning systems currently available. 
I also want to get involved in the flip side of this, which is to use computation to further advances in linguistics (such as discourse modelling or language acquisition).

I'm always interested in the debate of whether we need linguistics for NLP. I'm also very interested in the question of whether NLP and language acquisition are converging &ndash; whether the trending "more data and bigger models" approach to NLP will end up converging on a structure remarkably similar to how humans learn and encode language. 

One day, I want to pursue a project on Swiss German, my other fluent language, and one of the curious ways in which it differs from Standard German, but right now that will have to yield to all my semantics projects...

When I'm not doing research, you can find me reading, hiking (ideally in the Swiss Alps!) and spoiling my fluffy black cat, Aurora.
