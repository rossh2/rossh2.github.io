I'm a PhD student studying Linguistics at Harvard University, with a focus on computational linguistics and semantics.

Iâ€™m interested in how we can use linguistics and experimental data to pin down language models' capabilities and limitations and develop ways to improve them. 
Language models like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm, but we're still far from understanding exactly how they achieve such impressive performance on a wide range of real-life tasks &ndash; and why they still fail to handle important aspects of language ranging from [simple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08189) [negation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.272) to [entity tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02363). I'm currently investigating whether large language models have a sense of how to compose meanings into larger pieces, specifically whether they're able to generalize to new cases of adjective-noun composition (and for that matter, whether humans generalize as well as theories predict).

In additional to language models, I also work on experimental semantics: working with Kathryn Davidson and Gennaro Chierchia, we're developing a [robust experiment design](/assets/publications/Ross-et-al_SuB_Crossover_Proceedings.pdf) to test pronoun reference in crossover configurations, which are the subject of much theoretical literature and remarkably divided opinions on whether crossover applies to non-standard cases like indefinites or relative clauses.
