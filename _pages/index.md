I'm a second year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University.

My dream is to combine theoretical semantics and computational linguistics. I have a deep love for logic and lambda calculus, and my current theoretical work focuses on anaphora and indefinites with a side serving of modality. (One of my current questions is whether classical logic is the right way to tackle indefinites at all.) 
I also believe that there's a lot of scope to use linguistics, in particular semantics, to tackle issues currently outside the bounds of modern NLP. 
Marrying linguistic theory with machine learning will open doors to problems that aren't easily solved just with more and more data, and should take us from approximate solutions to 100% confidence, accurate answers on linguistically motivated problems.
