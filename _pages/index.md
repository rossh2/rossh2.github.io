I'm a PhD student studying Linguistics at Harvard University, with a focus on computational linguistics and semantics.

Iâ€™m interested in how we can use linguistics and experimental data to pin down language models' capabilities and limitations and develop ways to improve them. 
Language models like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm, but we're still far from understanding how they actually achieve such impressive performance on a wide range of real-life tasks &endash; and why they still fail to handle important aspects of language meaning ranging from seemingly [simple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08189) [negation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.272) to more subtle problems like [entity tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02363). I'm currently investigating whether large language models understand compositionality, focusing on whether they're able to generalize to new cases of adjective-noun composition.

Language models also provide an intriguing window into human linguistic behaviour. In cases where human &ldquo;snap&rdquo; judgements or online processing measures diverge from their final conclusions, language model surprisal can provide a [remarkably good account of human behaviour](https://doi.org/10.1162/nol_a_00105), suggesting humans may be be using distributional information in these cases. They might also provide insight in cases where human judgements are [context-sensitive or otherwise fuzzy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08694) as opposed to following strict theoretical rules.

In additional to language models, I also work on experimental semantics: working with Kathryn Davidson and Gennaro Chierchia, we're developing a [robust experiment design](/assets/publications/Ross-et-al_SuB_Crossover_Proceedings.pdf) to test pronoun reference in crossover configurations, which are the subject of much theoretical literature and remarkably divided opinions on whether crossover applies to non-standard cases like indefinites or relative clauses.
