I'm a second year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University.

I'm interested in formal semantics and computational linguistics, and in particular how the two can be combined. 
I'm doing research in theoretical and experimental semantics, but I also believe that there's a lot of scope to use linguistics to tackle issues currently outside the bounds of modern NLP. 
One of my current sources of excitement is marrying linguistic theory with machine learning: this will open doors to problems that aren't easily solved just with more and more data, and should take us from approximate solutions to 100% confidence, accurate answers on linguistically motivated problems. 
On the flip side, computational models can give us insight into everything from implicatures and discourse maxims to language acquisition.

My current research focuses on anaphora, but modality, implicatures and just in general meaning "between the lines" are all areas that I have pursued and/or want to pursue more.
