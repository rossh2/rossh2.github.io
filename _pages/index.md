I'm a second year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University.

I'm interested in formal semantics and computational linguistics, and in particular how the two can be combined. My current theoretical work focuses on anaphora and indefinites. While I have an abiding love for logic and lambda calculus, I'm currently questioning whether classical logic is the right way to tackle indefinites and discourse referents. I want to spend more time pursuing modality, implicatures and in general meaning "between the lines".

I also believe that there's a lot of scope to use linguistics to tackle issues currently outside the bounds of modern NLP.
One of my current sources of excitement is marrying linguistic theory with machine learning: this will open doors to problems that aren't easily solved just with more and more data, and should take us from approximate solutions to 100% confidence, accurate answers on linguistically motivated problems.
