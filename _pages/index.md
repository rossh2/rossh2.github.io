I'm a third year PhD student studying Linguistics at Harvard University.

My dream is to combine theoretical semantics and computational linguistics. I have a deep love for logic and lambda calculus, and my current theoretical work focuses on anaphora and crossover.
I also believe that there's a lot of scope to use linguistics, in particular semantics, to tackle issues currently outside the bounds of modern NLP. 

Linguistics lets us shed light on the true capabilities of large language models by letting us probe what specific structures and phenomena language models can and cannot capture. I'm currently investigating whether large language models understand a range of syntax-semantics mapping phenomena focused around thematic roles.

Marrying linguistic theory with machine learning may also open doors to problems that aren't easily solved just with more and more data. We can use linguistic typology to structure cross-lingual transfer learning, and enforce syntactic, semantic or pragmatic structure in systems to guarantee well-formed outputs, add explainability, or achieve that last mile of accuracy that can't be reached with statistical patterns alone.
