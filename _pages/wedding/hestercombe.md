## Accommodation

We have negotiated a 10% discount with the [Holiday Inn Express](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/gb/en/taunton/tntuk/hoteldetail) hotel in Taunton. 
Double rooms work out at £133/night with the discount at the time of writing (£148/night at list price), including breakfast. 
The hotel is located on the outskirts of Taunton just off the M25, and there is free parking. 
If you would like to be part of this (and we hope you will), please let us know in the RSVP form and we'll send you the discount link.

For people coming by train, we also recommend the [Great Western Hotel](https://thegreatwesternhotel.org/), which is located right by Taunton train station. 
Double rooms are £110/night at the time of writing (no group discount), including breakfast, and it's a 20min walk into the city centre. 
There is no parking at this hotel. 

Let us know if you need any help booking either of these!
If neither of these options catch your fancy, let us know since we have looked at a number of other hotels and B&Bs in and around Taunton and may be able to help you find something.

## How to get to Hestercombe

We're organising a minibus which will stop at each of the above hotels (the Holiday Inn Express and the Great Western Hotel / Taunton train station) to take you to and from the wedding. 
The minibus will depart between 1:00-1:30pm (to be confirmed) from the hotels and return at 11:00pm from Hestercombe. 
If you would like a ride, please let us know on the RSVP form!

### Directions to Hestercombe

**Use the postcode TA2 8LQ for GPS/sat navs**

The route is marked out with brown daisy signs from the motorway all the way to Cheddon Fitzpaine.
Upon following the sign from Cheddon Fitzpaine, stay on the main road until you reach Hestercombe Gardens. Do not take a turn onto Hestercombe Road as this will take you to the farm and not to Hestercombe Gardens.

There is a car park directly at the entrance to Hestercombe, separate to the main visitor car park. Hestercombe staff will be on hand to show you where to go.

The nearest railway station is Taunton. For more information, including detailed directions and a list of taxi companies, see [Hestercombe's Find Us](https://www.hestercombe.com/your-visit/find-us) page.
