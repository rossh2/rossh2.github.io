## Accommodation

We have negotiated a group booking discount with the (...) hotel in Taunton, for ... for the night from Saturday to Sunday. If you would like to be involved in this (and we hope you will), please let us know in the RSVP form so that we can give the final numbers to the hotel.  

## How to get to Hestercombe

We will organise a minibus from the hotel in Taunton to the venue and back, departing at 1:30pm (to be confirmed) from Taunton and at 11:00pm from Hestercombe. If you would like a ride, please let us know on the RSVP form.

### Directions to Hestercombe

**Use the postcode TA2 8LQ for GPS/sat navs**

The route is marked out with brown daisy signs from the motorway all the way to Cheddon Fitzpaine.
Upon following the sign from Cheddon Fitzpaine, stay on the main road until you reach Hestercombe Gardens. Do not take a turn onto Hestercombe Road as this will take you to the farm and not to Hestercombe Gardens.

There is a car park directly at the entrance to Hestercombe, separate to the main visitor car park. Hestercombe staff will be on hand to show you where to go.

The nearest railway station is Taunton. For more information, including detailed directions and a list of taxi companies, see [Hestercombe's Find Us](https://www.hestercombe.com/your-visit/find-us) page.
