* Honey and mustard glazed ham

This is followed by dessert and, of course, wedding cake. Wine will be offered with dinner and a bar will be available during the dancing if you wish to purchase additional alcoholic drinks. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let us know in the RSVP form.

## Sunday

We're also organising a casual lunch on Sunday in the centre of Taunton, if you'd like to join us and if that fits with your travel plans. 

Lunch is booked for **12:00pm** at [Hideout](https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/somerset/hideout/) in the centre of Taunton. The address is Castle Green, Taunton, Somerset, TA1 4AE and the closest car parks are the [Crescent](https://www.somersetwestandtaunton.gov.uk/parking/car-parks-in-taunton/the-crescent-car-park/) and [Whirligig Lane](https://www.somersetwestandtaunton.gov.uk/parking/car-parks-in-taunton/whirligig-lane-car-park/) car parks.

## How to get to Hestercombe

The minibus will depart between 1:00-1:30pm (to be confirmed) from the hotels and return at 11:00pm from Hestercombe. 
If you would like a ride, please let us know on the RSVP form!

### Directions to Hestercombe

**Use the postcode TA2 8LQ for GPS/sat navs**

The route is marked out with brown daisy signs from the motorway all the way to Cheddon Fitzpaine.
Upon following the sign from Cheddon Fitzpaine, stay on the main road until you reach Hestercombe Gardens. Do not take a turn onto Hestercombe Road as this will take you to the farm and not to Hestercombe Gardens.

There is a car park directly at the entrance to Hestercombe, separate to the main visitor car park. Hestercombe staff will be on hand to show you where to go.

The nearest railway station is Taunton. For more information, including detailed directions and a list of taxi companies, see [Hestercombe's Find Us](https://www.hestercombe.com/your-visit/find-us) page.

## Accommodation

We have negotiated a 10% discount with the [Holiday Inn Express](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/gb/en/taunton/tntuk/hoteldetail) hotel in Taunton. 
Double rooms work out at £133/night with the discount at the time of writing (£148/night at list price), including breakfast. 
The hotel is located on the outskirts of Taunton just off the M25, and there is free parking. 
If you would like to be part of this, please let us know in the RSVP form and we'll send you the discount link.

For people coming by train, we also recommend the [Great Western Hotel](https://thegreatwesternhotel.org/), which is located right by Taunton train station. 
Double rooms are £110/night at the time of writing (no group discount), including breakfast, and it's a 20min walk into the city centre. 
There is no parking at this hotel. 

Let us know if you need any help booking either of these!
If neither of these options catch your fancy, let us know since we have looked at a number of other hotels and B&Bs in and around Taunton and may be able to help you find something.

## Wedding gifts

Since we're flying over from the US, we'll be severely limited on luggage space to bring gifts back home. If you'd like to give us a gift at the UK wedding, please keep it small and light! 
Alternatively, we have a **[wedding registry on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/wedding/hayley-ross-paul-cummer--june-2022/registry/31I9YKCDJTCY3)**, where you can send presents directly to our US address. (No need to stick to presents on the registry if you have the perfect idea.) 
Amazon unfortunately doesn't allow items to be reserved and sent later, so feel free to send them any time between now and the wedding.

_Note about the Amazon registry: Certain items show as "Out of Stock". These items aren't actually out of stock, but are currently only sold by third party sellers. They may also come back in stock between now and the wedding. We'll keep an eye on this and update the registry if it happens to too many items!_
