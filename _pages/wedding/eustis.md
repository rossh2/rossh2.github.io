## How to get to Eustis Estate

Eustis Estate is located at  
1424 Canton Avenue  
Milton, MA 02186

There is a large, free visitor parking lot next to the visitor center at the top of the driveway.

If you won't have a car and would like to share a ride to Eustis Estate, let us know in the RSVP form and we'll try to connect you with someone local.

## Wedding gifts

If you'd like to give us a wedding gift, we have a **[wedding registry on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/wedding/hayley-ross-paul-cummer--june-2022/registry/31I9YKCDJTCY3)**. (No need to stick to presents on the registry if you have the perfect idea.) 
Amazon unfortunately doesn't allow items to be reserved and sent later, so feel free to send them any time between now and the wedding.

_Note about the Amazon registry: Certain items show as "Out of Stock". These items aren't actually out of stock, but are currently only sold by third party sellers. They may also come back in stock between now and the wedding. We'll keep an eye on this and update the registry if it happens to too many items!_
