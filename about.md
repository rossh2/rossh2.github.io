# About Hayley

I'm a first year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University. I have a background in mathematics (MMath, University of Oxford, 2015) and computational linguistics (MS, Brandeis University, 2020), and my research explores how we can use linguistics to inform computational linguistics and NLP and vice versa. I believe that linguistics will be the key to tackling computationally hard problems such as anaphora, modality, discourse and in particular meaning "between the lines" including implicatures, presupposition and indirect answers to questions. I'm also interested applying computational thinking to linguistics, ranging from applying continuations to semantics to using deep neural language models to better understand language acquisition.

I'm always interested in the debate of whether we need linguistics for NLP. I'm also very interested in the question of whether NLP and language acquisition are converging &ndash; whether the trending "more data and bigger models" approach to NLP will end up converging on a structure remarkably similar to how humans learn and encode language. If you ever see me in the hallways at Harvard or at a conference, feel free to stop me to chat about any of this!

When I'm not thinking about computational linguistics, you can usually find me in the mathematical end of semantics working on modality, anaphora or anything else with a lot of lambda calculus. I'm also currently working on a fun project involving nanosyntax for Germanic morphology.

Last but not least, I'm British but I grew up in Switzerland, near Zurich, so I also speak that famously context-sensitive language of Swiss German. The ways in which Swiss German differs from Standard German is often on the back of my mind, especially in the broader context of Switzerland's unusual diglossia situation.
