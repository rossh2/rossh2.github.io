# Welcome

I'm a first year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University.

I'm interested in formal semantics, and also how we can use linguistics to inform computational linguistics and NLP and vice versa. I believe that linguistics will be the key to tackling computationally hard problems such as anaphora, modality, discourse and in particular meaning "between the lines" including implicatures, presupposition and indirect answers to questions. I'm also interested applying computational thinking to linguistics, ranging from applying continuations to semantics to using deep neural language models to better understand language acquisition.

When I'm not thinking about computational linguistics, you can usually find me in the mathematical end of semantics working on modality, anaphora or anything else with a lot of lambda calculus.
